Question

Write a recursive function called sum_list that takes a list of integers as an input and returns the sum of all elements in the list. 

Your solution should:
1. Use recursion
2. Handle empty lists (return 0)
3. Explanation of time complexity of your solution

For example:
- sum_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 15
- sum_list([]) should return 0
- sum_list([10]) should return 10
